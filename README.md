# **Description:**
This project is a Python-based tool designed for synchronizing and combining two GoPro videos using a graphical user interface (GUI). The tool allows users to independently load left and right video files, enabling them to perform real-time synchronization and combine the videos into one seamless output. Built with Tkinter for the GUI and OpenCV for video processing, this tool provides an intuitive way to stitch videos and verify their synchronization through visual feedback. The project aims to simplify the process of working with multiple video streams, such as those captured by GoPro cameras mounted at different angles üé•.

The GUI is the central interface for users to interact with the video files. It allows users to load videos, view frames from each video, and control playback with simple buttons to advance or reverse each frame. The intuitive layout helps users adjust and synchronize the videos with ease. A larger preview window is provided to show the stitched video output, giving users real-time feedback on their adjustments. The GUI is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that even non-technical users can efficiently work with video synchronization and combining üì±.

The tool functions by displaying frames from both the left and right videos, with controls to advance or reverse each video frame by frame. Users can manage synchronization issues by adjusting the video playback and fine-tuning the alignment using the provided GUI controls. The combined output is processed using techniques such as alpha blending and Gaussian blur for smooth transitions between the videos. Once the videos are synchronized, users can generate a final stitched video with corrected perspectives, which can be saved at the desired resolution and codec. This process ensures seamless integration of the two video streams üåü.

The core of the project is powered by OpenCV, a widely used computer vision library that handles video capture, frame processing, and video output generation. OpenCV enables video frame extraction, manipulation, and alignment, while Pillow (for image processing) supports resizing and displaying images in the GUI. Tkinter, the standard Python GUI toolkit, provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the video controls and managing the synchronization process üñ•Ô∏è.

The project relies on a few key dependencies that need to be installed for proper functionality. These include OpenCV for video manipulation, Pillow for image handling, NumPy for array operations, and Tkinter, which comes pre-installed with Python. These libraries ensure that video processing, frame manipulation, and GUI operations run smoothly, providing a robust environment for the user to work with video data üîß.

The output of this tool is a seamlessly combined video file that merges both left and right video streams into a single, synchronized video. This final video can be saved in various formats, ensuring flexibility for further use. The stitched video is free from visual artifacts and perspective mismatches, offering users a smooth, high-quality output suitable for various applications üé¨.
